# Arch-Boki system installation



**Arch-Boki** is a customizable Arch Linux ISO builder based on the [BUILDRA](https://github.com/buildra) [KIRO](https://github.com/kirodubes) project. It provides a simple way to build your own Arch-based installation medium with your choice of packages, settings, and scripts.
